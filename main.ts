/**
 * Put together the puzzle! We want small and large diamond icons to animate when the sound level is above a certain number. When the level is below that number, we want the microbit to be blank. 
 * 
 * Forever
 * 
 * While the sound level is greater than/equal to 100, do show icon (big diamond) and show icon (little diamond).
 * 
 * Lastly, AFTER the loop block, clear screen. Then test!
 * 
 * ***Use the search! You will need:
 * 
 * -forever block 
 * 
 * -while true/do loop block
 * 
 * - ___=___ logic block (change it to the correct comparison symbol)
 * 
 * -ROUND sound level block
 * 
 * -clear screen block
